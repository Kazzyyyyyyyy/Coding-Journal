# Coding-Journal

Hi! This is the "main README" for my coding journey.  
Here, I will document all Ive learned, what Im working on right now, and my future plans/projects.



## My first 7 months of coding (march - october .2025)

**ToDoList:** 
Started as a simple console project to learn the basics of C#. After a month, it was a WPF program with SQLite integration, CRUD operations, and settings.

*Note:* The code is very messy. Not recommended for reuse.


**SQLMonitor:** 
A program to live manage SQLite databases.  
Supports CRUD, undo, and additional operations for the entire database. 
Features the first fully self-made GUI, auto-update/live visualization, table structure analysis, and multiple options for filtering information and managing functions.

*Note:* The code is very messy. Not recommended for reuse.
  

**SnowpeakPuzzle-SolveAlgorithm:** 
An algorithm to solve the Snowpeak Ruins ice puzzle from Zelda: Twilight Princess. This was my first introduction to algorithms.  
It has one simple rule: no backtracking, and finds a solution that uses fewer than 20 moves.

*Note:* The code is EXTREMELY messy, had alot of stack-overflow problems => put everything in one loop. Not recommended for reuse. 


**AlgorithmVisualizer:**
Started as a console program with a simple maze generation algorithm. Later ported to WPF, including MazeGenerator (imperfect/perfect), A-Star, BFS, DeadEndFilling, Right/Left-HandRule, and RandomMove.  
All of this with live visualization (async), adjustable algorithm speed, and maze/visualizer size settings.

*Note:* The code is not perfect, but mostly readable and understandable. This was my first deep dive into good coding practices.


**10 leetcode problems (C++):** 
My first experience with LeetCode, and also my first time programming in C++. 
After 6.5 months of C#, I decided to switch to C++ because I always wanted to do low-level programming and had learned all the programming basics necessary for the switch.  
And if not now, when?


**TicTacToe:**
This was my first non-LeetCode C++ project. I created a simple, typical beginner TicTacToe game, but the algorithm plays near perfectly.  
If the CPU starts, you cannot win.



## Ongoing journey (october 2025 â€“ today)

My plan from here on is to dive deeper into low-level programming so that I can become an employed (normal job/freelancer group...) junior dev within the next year.  
I try to double or even triple my current knowledge about algorithms, memory management, and stuff like that over the next 8 months.  
Overall, my goal is to become as skilled as possible in my favorite part of coding.

### Currently working on 
 - remaking algorithms (MazeGen, A-Star, BFS), I alr made in c#, in c++ from scratch (without STL) and focus on performance

### Weekly updates
**Week 1 (6. - 12.10.2025):**
 - pointers
 - linked lists
 - 4 LeetCode problems (linked list)

**Week 2 (13. - 19.10.2025):**
 - STL containers from scratch (Stack, Vector, PriorityQueue, HashTable)
 - templates 
 - operator[] 

**Week 3 (20. - 26.10.2025):**
 - Finished the STL container project (Queue, HashSet, testing, fixing bugs, cleaning up the code)
 - started a new project: adding ultra performance C++ algorithms to my C# MazeSolverVisualizer (still dont got a good name for that project :/ ) 
 - understood and implemented MemoryMappedFiles for C#/C++ communication (C# struct/char[] => C++) 
 - made an ultra optimized BFS algorithm (0.6ms for a 200x200 imperfect maze) and learned a lot of optimization methods through that
